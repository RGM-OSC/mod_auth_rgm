Apache2 Form-Based Authorization Module
----------------------------------------

Overview
--------

This module is a form-based authorization module based on 
'mod_auth_mysql' and 'mod_auth_sim'. It is used to place access
restrictions on a per-directory, per-user-request basis using
session management. The module uses a MySQL database to retrieve
users' group membership, maintain and validate users' sessions,
and optionally track user activity.

The mechanics of the module works in the following way. A web
client (user) requests for a restricted page/directory. The module
sends back a 'Page Has Moved' error, pointing the client to the page
containing a login form. Through server-side scripting, a session is
created in the MySQL database and the client (i.e. cookies or query
string). The session itself consists of a unique, random, and temporary
ID that is associated with a user. The client then makes the same
request along with the session ID (SID) and the user ID (UID). The
module compares and validates the two IDs against the IDs stored in the
MySQL database. If successful, the module sends back the requested
page; otherwise, the module once again sends back the 'Page Has Moved'
error page. In addition (if specified), the module will also validate
the user's group membership and act accordingly.
